Team Leader Progress Day 3:
created template to request permission to use teacher likenesses (contained below)

Hello _____________,
	
	I am writing to you in order to request permission to use your likeness for the current project being worked on in the Computer Science Advanced Topics Honors class. I and seven other students have been tasked with creating a video game to share with the school, and we are planning to include all of HGP’s teachers as characters in the game. The player will have to “defeat” all the teachers in order to win the game. It is all in good taste, but we just wanted to request permission from all the teachers to avoid any issues. If you have any questions or would like something specific included as a part of your character in the game, feel free to reach out. Please let me know if this is okay with you.
Thanks,
